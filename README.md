# "And All Was Silent" - naive universe generator / lore generator - python 3
Universe-Generator (properly named "And All Was Silent") is a naive universe generator/sci-fi lore generator based in Python 3.


### **Required Libraries**
* random
* string
* time
* sys
* numpy

#### **Included Libraries**
* log_script - Script to output log file as well as print to console. Source is in comments.
* genlib - Helper functions. Mostly created to divide up the many hundreds of lines of helper functions I originally had. The point now seems moot, because genlib is getting near 500 lines long and will not stop growing in the forseeable future.
* wordgen - Script to randomly generate words. Source is in comments.
* ansi_color - Helper to use ANSI color codes.

### Usage

Clone repo or download zip. Keep all files in same directory. Launch from console or command line/Anaconda prompt: `python generator.py`.

After generator runs, an output file called `genlog.txt` will be found in the directory.
